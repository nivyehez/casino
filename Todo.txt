Question for instructor:
1.	Is it possible to send a custom object?
	Can it be defined in an external file, and included via imprort? (3 files)
2.	Question about the code:
	t = threading.Thread(target=Game, args=(client,))# is this legal?
	can the GC destroy the Game object during its run?
3. 	View the status in the middle of the game - the meaning is whener the player is able to send a message, or as a general interrupt?
